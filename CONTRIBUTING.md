# Contributing to saskatoon-ng

Contributions are more than welcome!

## Setup

Please follow instructions in `INSTALL.md` to set up your local development environment.


## Branches

Unless instructed otherwise by maintainers all pull requests should target the `develop` branch.

If your branch directly addresses an opened `Issue`, you may name your branch using the following scheme: `Fix-<Issue#>-A_short_description`

Maintainers may create specific `Feature-<Issue#>-A_short_description` branches for larger issues so contributors can merge their patches into these branches before they get integrated into `develop`.


## Pull requests

Please reference the Issue number(s) your contribution is addressing, either in the Pull Request's title or in the first comment.

To ease the review process, you may include screenshots, links to routes you've altered and a description of what was modified and why (e.g. in a bullet points form).

If your pull request is still a *Work in Progress*, please mark it as `Draft`.


## Commits

If possible, squash your commits into a minimal number of relevant commits before finalizing your pull request. If you are unsure how to do it but are interested, feel free to ask for help.

Although we don't have strict guidelines regarding commit messages, we recommend taking a look at [this practical guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/) to write better commits.

If a commit message directly addresses an `Issue` it might be relevant to include the issue number in the commit message, e.g.: `[#119] Add postal_code field to PropertyAdmin list_display`.


## Migrations

If you alter any `<app>.models.py` file, make sure make sure to run `python manage.py makemigrations <app>** to include migrations along with the changes. 

**Please only submit one migration file per app per pull request.** If you are not sure how to achieve this ask us for help and we will guide you through.

Thanks!
